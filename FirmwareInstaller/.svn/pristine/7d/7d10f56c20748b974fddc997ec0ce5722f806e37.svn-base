For some reason TFTPServer is in the apache documentation for commons-net but isn't in the jar.
I speculate it is only in the test code.
http://commons.apache.org/proper/commons-net/testapidocs/org/apache/commons/net/tftp/TFTPServer.html

So i have taken the source code provided in the source download and added it to the resources of my-lib

NOTE:
This is not my code and I havenpt edited it!
